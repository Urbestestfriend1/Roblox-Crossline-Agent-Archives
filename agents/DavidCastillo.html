<h1>AGENT DOSSIER – DAVID "BULWARK" CASTILLO</h1>
<p><b>Codename:</b> AXIOM</p>
<p><b>Division:</b> ALTA Recon</p>
<p><b>Age:</b> 29</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
David Castillo grew up in a rough neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, where he learned early how to step in 
    when someone needed protecting. He was a kid who broke up fights, shielded smaller kids from trouble, and absorbed punches 
    without blinking. His mother used to say he had “a heart too big for the world and shoulders built to carry it.

At 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army—not because he wanted glory, but because he wanted structure, purpose, 
    and a way to protect people at scale. David quickly became known for two things:

    He never backed down from a front-line assignment.
    He fought like a living barricade.

During his time in a mechanized infantry unit, David specialized in breach entry, 
    protective formations, and urban combat. He became the go-to guy for situations where a 
    team needed someone who could take the hit so the rest didn’t have to.

<h2>ALTA Recruitment</h2>
<p>
When the ALTA program was formed — a multi-national, <span class="redacted">█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</span> — David was one of the first contacted. 
    They wanted someone with:
unbreakable presence
high physical resilience
zero ego
loyalty built into his bones

He accepted not because he trusted the organization.
but because he believed in the protection of civilians.

For David, ALTA isn’t politics or command structure.
